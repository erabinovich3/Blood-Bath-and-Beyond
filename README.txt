Blood Bath and Beyond Gameplay Instructions:

Use WASD or the arrow keys to control your mom, and use the mouse to control her direction.
Click to throw either a tampon or soap. Control which weapon you are using with the left ALT key.
Make sure to hit boys with soap and girls with tampons. Using the wrong thing for the wrong teen will result in a loss of points.
Get at least the target score before time runs out in order to successfully complete the level.
Pick up wine powerups to get some time back.
